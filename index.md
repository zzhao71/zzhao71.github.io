## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Anjalie Field](https://anjalief.github.io/) and [Yinzhi Cao](https://yinzhicao.org/).

My research focuses on developing algorithms and systems for trustworthy AI, specifically addressing safety, privacy, and alignment challenges in large language and vision models.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, and a minor in Psychology.

I’m always happy to collaborate! If you’re interested in working together, feel free to reach out to me at zzhao71[at]jhu.edu.
