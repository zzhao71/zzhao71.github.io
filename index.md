## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Anjalie Field](https://anjalief.github.io/) and [Yinzhi Cao](https://yinzhicao.org/).

I am interested in the natural language processing, particularly the safety and privacy of large language models. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, and a minor in Psychology.


## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing:** privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs, LLM safety and alignment, model editing

- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning
